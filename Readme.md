# C# Tetris

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game in C#. The game features the standard Tetris gameplay, with falling pieces that must be arranged to form complete lines. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the screen.

Getting Started
To run the game, you will need Visual Studio installed on your computer. Clone this repository to your local machine and open the solution file in Visual Studio. Build the solution, and then run the Tetris project.

Gameplay
The game is controlled with the following keys:

- Left Arrow: Move the current piece left
- Right Arrow: Move the current piece right
- Down Arrow: Move the current piece down faster
- Up Arrow: Rotate the current piece
- Spacebar: Drop the current piece to the bottom
- The game will start with a random piece falling from the top of the screen. Use the arrow keys to move the piece and arrange it to form complete lines. Each complete line will be cleared, and the player will earn points. The game ends when the pieces stack up to the top of the screen.
